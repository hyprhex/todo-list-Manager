## ToDo List Manager with Python

### Description

The ToDo List Manager is a simple command-line-based application that allows users to manage their tasks in a digital ToDo list. The user interacts with the application using text commands to add, view, mark as completed, and remove tasks.

### Features

1. **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks to their ToDo list. The application prompts the user to enter the task description, and the task is then added to the list.

2. **View Tasks:** Users can view all the tasks in their ToDo list. The application displays a numbered list of tasks along with their status (completed or not completed).

3. **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed. The application prompts the user to enter the task number they want to mark as completed, and the status of the task is updated accordingly.

4. **Remove Task:** Users can remove tasks from the ToDo list. The application prompts the user to enter the task number they want to remove, and the corresponding task is deleted from the list.

5. **Save to File:** The ToDo list can be saved to a file (e.g., text file, JSON file) so that users can access their tasks even after closing the application.

6. **Load from File:** Upon starting the application, it can check if there is an existing file with tasks saved. If yes, the tasks are loaded from the file to continue the ToDo list.

### Potential Improvements

- Prioritizing tasks: Allow users to assign priorities to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low) to better manage their workload.
- Due dates: Incorporate due dates for tasks, and notify users of upcoming or overdue tasks.
- Multiple lists: Allow users to create and manage multiple ToDo lists for different projects or categories.
- User authentication: Implement a basic login system to manage different ToDo lists for different users.

### Learning Goals

- File handling: Learn how to read from and write to files to store and retrieve task data.
- Data structures: Practice using lists or dictionaries to manage task information.
- User input/output: Improve handling user input and displaying information to users in a user-friendly manner.
- Conditional statements and loops: Use these programming constructs to manage different tasks based on user choices.

Remember, the main aim of this project is to get hands-on experience with basic Python concepts and build something practical. Happy coding!
